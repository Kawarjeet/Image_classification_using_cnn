## Image Classification(Cats and Dogs) using 3 layered Convolutional Neural Network
### Steps:
### 1. Import dataset
### 2. Import Libraries and modules
### 3. Create Datastructures for Input Dataset and Output
### 4. Process the dataset for any unwanted files
### 5. Carry out Exploratory Data Analysis
### 6. Split dataset into Training and Validation Set
### 7. Carry out Image Augmentation 
### 8. Create a model using CNN
### 9. Train the model
### 10. Visualize the results


### Image classification are used everwhere from Facebook's photo tagging to self driving car.

### A CNN is ideal for 2-D images. 
### CNNs have an input layer, and output layer, and hidden layers. 
### The hidden layers usually consist of convolutional layers, ReLU layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
